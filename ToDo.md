# List of things that can be worked on
* Add functions from imutils (https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils) to ImageTools
* Check to see if the OpenCV 3.0 lib used is a debug build (exceptions point to source files in my Downloads folder)
* Insure comments are correct on functions, comment code
* Work on ChessPieceFinder
* Get DFT and IDFT working correctly
