# List of things that can be worked on
* Add functions from imutils (https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils) to ImageTools
* Check to see if the OpenCV 3.0 lib used is a debug build (exceptions point to source files in my Downloads folder)
* Allow the computer screen to be captured as an image
* Change how TabManger adds tabs so it is generic and doesn't need functions added to use new tab types
* Add DFT processing for images
* Draw histogram for image

# Things to learn
* Building a string in Scala
* How to use case classes/remove loops with combinators
* Research Sudoku solvers for chess scanner example code

# Object Detection
* RANSAC
* Viola-Jones (Haar cascade)
* SVM with histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)
* gradient-based
* derivative-based
* template matching
* SURF and SIFT
* LBP cascades
